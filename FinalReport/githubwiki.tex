  \item Finally got modified version of openrave with warm cool shaders installed.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Solution was installing a fresh version of OpenRave into the /home/mcqueen folder. Additionally, we had to disable FCL to get OpenRave to compile.
  \end{itemize}
  \item Installation guide found in repo.
\end{itemize}

\subparagraph{Problems Encountered}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Had to go through many different version of OpenRave to finally find a working one. Versions used:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item OpenRave Repo found on robotics computer - didn't work due to openrave module error.
    \item Install script given to us by julio - didn't work because it lacked the qtcoin folder.
    \item Latest stable branch from openrave github repo - didn't work because FCL couldn't compile.
    \item Special branch off latest stable - didn't work because environment loading didn't work.

  \item Uploaded working OpenRave VM image.
  \item Began working on attempting to implement shadows/silhouettes.
\end{itemize}

\subparagraph{Problems Encountered}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Our silhouette and shadow implementations require us to know where the main loop (which we currently don't).

\subparagraph{Progress made this week}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Found a method to implement shadows using qt built ins.
\end{itemize}

\subparagraph{Problems Encountered}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Originally it was believed we would be able to find an openGL render loop to implement our changes into the system. However, we have figured out that attempting to access explicit openGL calls would be a waste of time, and that all rendering has to be done through the qt module.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{3mm}

\paragraph{Matt Huang}
\subparagraph{Plans for next week}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Try to find a way to implement shadows and silhouettes.

\subparagraph{Progress made this week}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Created silhouette shader, but have not properly implemented it yet.
  \item Updated coin3D.
  \item Thoroughly went through qtcoinviewer.cpp
\end{itemize}

\subparagraph{Problems Encountered}
\begin{itemize}
  \item We spent a lot of time trying to find the original main loop so that we could do double buffering. Ultimately we decided that this was a fruitless effort. For now, we'll have to use the provided qt submodules to implement silhouettes \& shadows.
  \item Although shadow shaders have a specific submodule to implement them, silhouettes don't.

\subparagraph{Progress made this week}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Set up submodule to keep track of code changes and created instructions for submodule use.
  \item Searched for the render loop in the simulator and possible alternatives online.
  \item Justin was able to locate some built in functions for shadows within Coin3D.
\end{itemize}

\subparagraph{Problems Encountered}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The design and dependencies of the simulation is often confusing.
  \item The lack of good documentation online is taking a lot of resources from the team, as we are forced to understand the code and dependencies through trial and error.

\subparagraph{Progress made this week}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Implemented shadows by using a a default class, shadow group class, within coin3d's extended library that we didn't have originally in our source.
  \item Made adjustments to the design document to reflect the usage of the shadow group class to create shadows in the simulation. These shadows are created by using shadow maps, and not by using my originally planned usage of shadow volumes.
\end{itemize}

\subparagraph{Problems Encountered}
\begin{itemize}
  \item My implementation of the shadows blocks out the usage of other shaders. This is because the shadow group class uses it's own created vertex and fragment shader. We will most likely have to override and rewrite the shaders that the shadow group class is using.
  \item The current implementation of shadows is casting shadows through objects, creating an overlapped shadow effect.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Matt Huang}
\subparagraph{Plans for next week}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Try to access glCullFace and glDepthMask functions in qtcoinviewer for the silhouettes.
  \item Continue investigating multi-rendering in qtcoin.
\end{itemize}

\subparagraph{Progress made this week}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Justin implemented shadows using the built in qtcoin3D widget.
  \item I altered the gooch shading code to add more color variety and smoother color transitions.
  \item Repaired silhouettes partially; still need access to depth mask and cull function for it to be fully implemented.
  \item Wrote progress report.
  \item Recorded progress report video.
  \item Revised design document. I personally revised the Gooch shading and silhouette sections.
  \item Combined the code I was working on with the code Justin had.
  \item Investigate alternative silhouette techniques (geometry shader, edge calculations).
  \item Made mock of our poster
\end{itemize}

\subparagraph{Problems Encountered}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Still haven't figured out a way to do multi-rendering in qtcoin.
  \item Still haven't figured out how to use the depth mask and cullface function in qtcoin.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Implement shadows.
\end{itemize}

\subparagraph{Progress made this week}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Found a process to do multi-pass rendering in openrave.
  \item Implemented silhouettes with warm cool shading.
\end{itemize}

\subparagraph{Problems Encountered}
\begin{itemize}
  \item It was a major struggle to figure out why are silhouettes didn't work. If we implemented our own object it would work. However, all other models wouldn't be drawn properly with the silhouettes. We found out that the problem was that item.cpp was overriding our style implementation.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Matt Huang}
\subparagraph{Plans for next week}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Implement Shadows
\end{itemize}

\subparagraph{Progress made this week}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Finally found how to do multi-rendering within qtcoinviewer.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item This is done by creating a SoSeparator instance for every render pass and then adding it to the root.
  \end{itemize}
  \item Implemented working silhouettes on top of warmcool shading. Required use of the SoShapeHints library and editing of item.cpp.
\end{itemize}

\subparagraph{Problems Encountered}
\begin{itemize}
  \item We had a lot of trouble identifying why silhouettes would work with Open Inventor objects but not the hanoi scene. Turns out that the item.cpp folder was overwriting our cull functions. Disabling that resulted in success.

\subsubsection{Week 8}
\paragraph{Justin Bibler}
If you were to redo the project from Fall term, what would you tell yourself? \\ \par \vspace{3mm}

I would tell myself to research more into Openrave before trying to install it. 
The installation process took us significantly longer the it should have. 
I would also tell myself to look into coin3d a bit more, as that was the main way we interacted with the rendering. \\ \par \vspace{3mm}

What's the biggest skill you've learned? \\ \par \vspace{3mm}

I learned how to use an API that is old and outdated with minimal documentation. 
This is a skill that will be used in the future. 
As it is quite normal for code to be extremely undocumented, so the only way to learn it is by using it and finding small examples. \\ \par \vspace{3mm}

What did you like about the project, and what did you not? \\ \par \vspace{3mm}

I liked that it was about graphics, but I didn't like that it wasn't working with OpenGL. 
It was more working with coin3d, and coin3d had access to the OpenGL render. \\ \par \vspace{3mm}

What did you learn form your teammates? \\ \par \vspace{3mm}

I learned how to work with other people better. \\ \par \vspace{3mm}

If you were the client for this project, would you be satisfied with the work done? \\ \par \vspace{3mm}

I would be satisfied with the work done. \\ \par \vspace{3mm}

If your project were to be continued next year, what do you think needs to be worked on? \\ \par \vspace{3mm}

Our client still has some ideas she wants to implement such as the best view algorithm. 
Also the function that selected the best warm cool color could be made more expansive. 
Which would cause it to default less to blue/white. 
If possible, it would be great to separate the warm cool code out from the coin3d's SoShadowGroup class. \\ \par \vspace{3mm}

Expo experience: \\ \par \vspace{3mm}

The expo was fun, our project wasn't that interesting so we didn't get many people who wanted to talk about it with us. 
However, Mike Bailey stopped by and asked us a bunch of questions and that was really nice. \\ \par \vspace{3mm}
\vspace{3mm}

\paragraph{Matt Huang}
If I were to redo something from fall term, I would put more time into researching the OpenRave environment. 
Additionally, I would've also liked to install the initial code base so that we could've gotten to work quicker during winter term.
The project itself improved how I look at coding problems. 
Since our project was in such an outdated environment, we were constricted to a very small subset of solutions. 
Also, the solutions themselves were often strange or unorthodox. 
An example being our warm cool shaders and shadows which we had to implement in a single library file. \\ \par \vspace{3mm}

I thought the project itself was pretty engaging. 
The overall requirements were simple and easy to understand, but the actual implementations were challenging. 
I do wish that the environment was better (more up to date) so that we could've implemented more features however. 
As for my teammates, they were good at bouncing ideas off of. Whenever I was stuck on something, 
I could always voice the issue and we could always work through it. \\ \par \vspace{3mm}

Overall, I believe we did a good job on the project. 
We implemented all of the client's requirements and we kept a consistent work schedule. 
If this project were to be continued, additional object colors would likely be accounted for. Lastly, 
I thought our expo was alright; I wish more people were interested in the project, but I'm fine with what we got. \\ \par \vspace{3mm}

\vspace{3mm}
\paragraph{Daniel Goh}
The project that was assigned to our group was fitting as Justin and Matt has suitable skillset for the project. 
I, on the other hand was assigned to take on a more "project manager" role in which I do minimal coding, but take responsibilities in other matters such as documentation, presentation editing etc. 
Through this role, I've learned a great deal of communication and writing skills, notably during the preparation of the survey in which I needed to go through the OSU Institutional Review Board review process, and keeping constant communication and updates for our client throughout the term. 
These are good skills to have as when I enter the workforce, chances are, I will be required to report frequently, hold meetings and present presentations to my employers or future clients. \\ \par \vspace{3mm}

The project was not easy, and with my limited knowledge of how to implement the graphical requirements, there are clear limitations in my technical contribution. 
All I could contribute to the technical side of the project was the initial installation set up, and fixing the hardcoded path that was left by the previous developer. 
However, through this project, I got to pick up some graphical terminology and knowledge from my teammates, Justin and Matt, during our development meetup sessions. \\ \par \vspace{3mm}

As for the engineering expo, there was nothing much to talk about, as it was difficult for the attendants to appreciate our team's graphical improvements. 
Our team's main feat to the project was not just making things look prettier, but it was to dig into code that is undocumented, poorly maintained, and deeply abstracted from other developers, in addition to improving the graphics with ancient glsl versions, which granted the team with a limited set of tools. 
This feat is hard to relay to the general audience and some industry reps as this is a very narrowed project, for a specific purpose. It was definitely still fun to be able to participate in the expo with the team and to see how far we've come in the project.  \\ \par \vspace{3mm}

  \item Finally got modified version of openrave with warm cool shaders installed.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Solution was installing a fresh version of OpenRave into the /home/mcqueen folder. Additionally, we had to disable FCL to get OpenRave to compile.
  \end{itemize}
  \item Installation guide found in repo.
\end{itemize}

\subparagraph{Problems Encountered}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Had to go through many different version of OpenRave to finally find a working one. Versions used:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item OpenRave Repo found on robotics computer - didn't work due to openrave module error.
    \item Install script given to us by julio - didn't work because it lacked the qtcoin folder.
    \item Latest stable branch from openrave github repo - didn't work because FCL couldn't compile.
    \item Special branch off latest stable - didn't work because environment loading didn't work.

\subparagraph{Problems Encountered}
\begin{itemize}
  \item It seems that pure shaders alone won't be enough to implement the shadows. Another way of accessing the render loop will have to be looked for.

  \item Uploaded working OpenRave VM image.
  \item Began working on attempting to implement shadows/silhouettes.
\end{itemize}

\subparagraph{Problems Encountered}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Our silhouette and shadow implementations require us to know where the main loop (which we currently don't).

\subparagraph{Progress made this week}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Found a method to implement shadows using qt built ins.
\end{itemize}

\subparagraph{Problems Encountered}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Originally it was believed we would be able to find an openGL render loop to implement our changes into the system. However, we have figured out that attempting to access explicit openGL calls would be a waste of time, and that all rendering has to be done through the qt module.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{3mm}

\paragraph{Matt Huang}
\subparagraph{Plans for next week}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Try to find a way to implement shadows and silhouettes.

\subparagraph{Progress made this week}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Created silhouette shader, but have not properly implemented it yet.
  \item Updated coin3D.
  \item Thoroughly went through qtcoinviewer.cpp
\end{itemize}

\subparagraph{Problems Encountered}
\begin{itemize}
  \item We spent a lot of time trying to find the original main loop so that we could do double buffering. Ultimately we decided that this was a fruitless effort. For now, we'll have to use the provided qt submodules to implement silhouettes & shadows.
  \item Although shadow shaders have a specific submodule to implement them, silhouettes don't.

\subparagraph{Progress made this week}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Set up submodule to keep track of code changes and created instructions for submodule use.
  \item Searched for the render loop in the simulator and possible alternatives online.
  \item Justin was able to locate some built in functions for shadows within Coin3D.
\end{itemize}

\subparagraph{Problems Encountered}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The design and dependencies of the simulation is often confusing.
  \item The lack of good documentation online is taking a lot of resources from the team, as we are forced to understand the code and dependencies through trial and error.

\subparagraph{Progress made this week}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Implemented shadows by using a a default class, shadow group class, within coin3d's extended library that we didn't have originally in our source.
  \item Made adjustments to the design document to reflect the usage of the shadow group class to create shadows in the simulation. These shadows are created by using shadow maps, and not by using my originally planned usage of shadow volumes.
\end{itemize}

\subparagraph{Problems Encountered}
\begin{itemize}
  \item My implementation of the shadows blocks out the usage of other shaders. This is because the shadow group class uses it's own created vertex and fragment shader. We will most likely have to override and rewrite the shaders that the shadow group class is using.
  \item The current implementation of shadows is casting shadows through objects, creating an overlapped shadow effect.
\end{itemize}

\subparagraph{Plans for next week}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Try to access glCullFace and glDepthMask functions in qtcoinviewer for the silhouettes.
  \item Continue investigating multi-rendering in qtcoin.
\end{itemize}

\subparagraph{Progress made this week}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Justin implemented shadows using the built in qtcoin3D widget.
  \item I altered the gooch shading code to add more color variety and smoother color transitions.
  \item Repaired silhouettes partially; still need access to depth mask and cull function for it to be fully implemented.
  \item Wrote progress report.
  \item Recorded progress report video.
  \item Revised design document. I personally revised the Gooch shading and silhouette sections.
  \item Combined the code I was working on with the code Justin had.
  \item Investigate alternative silhouette techniques (geometry shader, edge calculations).
  \item Made mock of our poster
\end{itemize}

\subparagraph{Problems Encountered}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Still haven't figured out a way to do multi-rendering in qtcoin.
  \item Still haven't figured out how to use the depth mask and cullface function in qtcoin.
\end{itemize}

\subparagraph{Plans for next week}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Work on combining shadows and shaders with team.
  \item Work on silhouette with team.
\end{itemize}

\subparagraph{Progress made this week}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Updated design document and technology review with Qualtrics.
  \item Compiled documents and revisions and uploaded on OneNote.
  \item Created digital poster draft and posted on OneNote.
  \item Maintained all OneNote related items.
  \item Created the midterm progress report document.
  \item Created presentation slide for the midterm progress report.
  \item Recorded the midterm progress report presentation with team.
  \item Put together the midterm progress report video.
\end{itemize}

\subparagraph{Problems Encountered}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Preparing the documents and editing the video was the most time consuming task for my week. Other than that, no problems were encountered.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Justin Bibler}
\subparagraph{Plans for next week}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Implement shadows.
\end{itemize}

\subparagraph{Progress made this week}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Found a process to do multi-pass rendering in openrave.
  \item Implemented silhouettes with warm cool shading.
\end{itemize}

\subparagraph{Problems Encountered}
\begin{itemize}
  \item It was a major struggle to figure out why are silhouettes didn't work. If we implemented our own object it would work. However, all other models wouldn't be drawn properly with the silhouettes. We found out that the problem was that item.cpp was overriding our style implementation.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Matt Huang}
\subparagraph{Plans for next week}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Implement Shadows
\end{itemize}

\subparagraph{Progress made this week}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Finally found how to do multi-rendering within qtcoinviewer.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item This is done by creating a SoSeparator instance for every render pass and then adding it to the root.
  \end{itemize}
  \item Implemented working silhouettes on top of warmcool shading. Required use of the SoShapeHints library and editing of item.cpp.
\end{itemize}

\subparagraph{Problems Encountered}
\begin{itemize}
  \item We had a lot of trouble identifying why silhouettes would work with Open Inventor objects but not the hanoi scene. Turns out that the item.cpp folder was overwriting our cull functions. Disabling that resulted in success.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Daniel Goh}
\subparagraph{Plans for next week}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Visit the Research Office in Kerr to inquire about IRB review for survey.
  \item Submit documentations and application for running study to the Research Office if needed.
  \item Visit client to inquire about preferred color schemes.
  \item Meet up with team to work on code.
\end{itemize}

\subparagraph{Progress made this week}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Communicated to client regarding the progress of the project.
  \item Prepared documentation and example survey to review with the Research Office in OSU. This survey will be used as a performance metric for our team.
\end{itemize}

\subparagraph{Problems Encountered}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Oregon State University's website regarding studies requiring review is long-winded and confusing. Instead, I will be visiting the Research Office myself to get answers on any uncertainties regarding running a study.
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\subparagraph{Progress made this week}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Discovered a problem with implementing shadows.
\end{itemize}

\subparagraph{Problems Encountered}
\begin{itemize}
  \item I've been really busy with other school work this week so I didn't get much done in implementing the shadows. However, when our team went to work on it we discovered that our plans to implement shadows may not work at all. We are currently trying to devise a way to implement them.
\end{itemize}

\subparagraph{Plans for next week}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Continue to try to implement shadows.
\end{itemize}

\subparagraph{Progress made this week}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Researched different ways to implement shadows on top of warm/cool shaders. Found an issue regarding reassigning the gl_fragcolor.
\end{itemize}

\subparagraph{Problems Encountered}
\begin{itemize}
  \item We can't use both the warm/cool shaders and the shadows at the same time due to them overwriting each other's colors.
\end{itemize}

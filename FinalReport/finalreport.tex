\textbf{Requirement}  & \textbf{Change Details}  & \textbf{Comments} \\ \hline

Warm Cool Shading. & 
None. & 
Requirement did not change. \\ \hline

Silhouettes. & 
None. & 
Requirement did not change. \\ \hline

Shadows. & 
None. & 
Requirement did not change. \\ \hline

Initial render must be done within 30s. & 
None. & 
Requirement did not change. \\ \hline

Scene must run at a constant 30 fps. & 
Removed. & 
Requirement was not necessary for the client's purposes. \\ \hline

The system will work on an average modern computer. &
None. &
Requirement did not change. \\ \hline

The system will only run one simulation per window. &
None. &
Requirement did not change \\ \hline

The system shall run properly created simulations. &
None.
This means that the system will always run valid environment files. \\ \hline

System shall be easily maintained and upgraded.
Have well documented and easily testable functions.
Have functions with single, clear purposes. &
None. &
After speaking with Mike Bailey we discovered that testing graphics is primarily done be ensuring that separate computers create the same render. 
Opposed to unit testing which is very difficult and only analyzes fragment positions.
This process can be done by rendering the scene and examining it. 
In our implementations we have minimal amount of new functions.
This is because most of the work done was hacked into the initializations and uses built in coin3d modules. \\ \hline

The system shall continuously re-render the scene until completion of the simulation or software termination. &
None. &
Requirement did not change. \\ \hline

The system shall work on Linux operating systems. &
None. &
Operating systems became limited due to Openrave.
Our current implementation does work on Linux, within Ubuntu 16.04. \\ \hline

Outdated OpenGL libraries will be updated to utilize OpenGL 3.0 libraries. &
None. &
We were unable to directly import new libraries as this was abstracted out from us.
However, we did update the environment that was given to us to Ubuntu 16.04 which utilizes OpenGL 3.0 while rendering. \\ \hline

\hline
\textbf{Design}  & \textbf{Change Details} \\ \hline
Warm Cool Shading & 
Warm Cool shading is still done in vertex and fragment shaders, but those shaders are now created by SoShadowGroup.cpp. 
Therefore, the Warm Cool shading code is now in the SoShadowGroup library. 
Additionally, the Warm Cool shaders now adapt to the object's original color. 
This was necessary to prevent bad color mixtures such as blue and orange. 
Further details on how this was done can be found in the design document. \\ \hline
Silhouettes & Silhouettes are now done using the silhouette lines method. 
In other words, the silhouettes are rendered using GL\_LINES instead of polygons. 
This was done to keep consistent silhouette widths throughout all the rendered objects. \\ \hline
CodeXL & Removed since the fps requirement was removed. 
Additionally, CodeXL only works on Windows (our system runs on Ubuntu 16.04) and testing was done better by simply running the system on different machines. \\ \hline

\begin{tabular}{ | p{0.3\linewidth} | p{0.3\linewidth} | p{0.3\linewidth} | }
\hline
\textbf{Technology}  & \textbf{Change Details}  & \textbf{Comments} \\ \hline

Shading Method & 
Technology did not change (still uses Warm Cool shading), only implementation & 
As stated in the design doc., now adapts to the object's original color and is now implemented using the SoShadowGroup library. \\ \hline
Silhouettes &
Now uses GL\_LINES method instead of the silhouette edge algorithm. &
The silhouette edge algorithm required direct control over some OpenGL tools (like the view port and the depth buffer) that we did not have access to.
The GL\_LINES method was chosen because it has consistent silhouette widths throughout objects (cel shaded silhouettes did not). \\ \hline
Debugger  &
Went from CodeXL to testing using multiple machines to render the scene &
Firstly, as stated in the design doc. table, CodeXL only works on Windows while our system runs on Ubuntu 16.04 so we can not even use it.
Secondly, it's easier to test and debug this system by running the simulations on different computers and then examining the scene.
Lastly, the fps requirement was removed in our requirements document so optimization was not a focus. \\ \hline

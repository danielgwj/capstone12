# Better Graphics For a Robotics Grasping GUI
## Team 12: Shady Robots ##

### Background to the Project ###
Our client is using visualizations, of a robot hand grasping objects, to collect data online. This data is used to create a model of the human grasp. However, the current graphics in the visualizations are outdated. It is hard to see and understand the shapes and contact points represented in the scene. Because of this, users aren't confident in giving proper responses to the simulation. Thus, the graphics need to be updated to allow meaningful data to be collected.

To improve the robotic grasping visualization in OpenRave, we've implemented warm cool shaders, shadows and silhouettes to help users understand the simulation's geometry and movement. 

### Getting OpenRAVE to work ###
Please refer to Installation.txt in the repo for more details on getting OpenRAVE and our implementation to work on Ubuntu.

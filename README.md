# Better Graphics For a Robotics Grasping GUI
## Team 12: Shady Robots ##

### Background to the Project ###
Our client is conducting research to improve the robot grasping model. Data is collected online through the use of visuals created using the OpenRAVE simulation.

However, the simulation had outdated graphics that would affect the userâ€™s ability to understand the scene, resulting in low confidence when answering questions about the robot grasp.

### Getting OpenRAVE to work ###
Please refer to Installation.txt in the repo for more details on getting OpenRAVE and our implementation to work on Ubuntu.

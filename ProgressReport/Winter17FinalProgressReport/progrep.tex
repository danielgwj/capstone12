\textbf{Better Graphics for a Robotic Grasping GUI}

\section{Project Purpose and Goals}
The purpose of our project is to update the graphics of an existing program that creates a simulation of a robotic arm grasping objects.
The reasoning behind our desire to update the graphics is because our client is using online data collection methods using these visualizations.
However, the outdated graphics are making it difficult for users to give confident responses to the survey.
To fix this problem, we have created 4 major goals:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Implement warm cool shading.
\item Implement shadows.
\item Implement silhouettes.
\item Test to ensure our implementations improve user confidence using interviews.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Retrospective}
% This should include a detailed, week by week summary of activities, problems, solutions, and the like. 
% It should not include more than a summary of any documents produced. 
% If you have been taking the weekly updates seriously, this should be relatively trivial to complete.

% Example from Fall Term
% Week 1: Met up with our client to introduce ourselves and got an overview and the requirements of the the project. & 
% No new deltas were introduced this week. & 
% No new deltas. \\ \hline

% Week 8: Completed tech review and made minor edits to requirements document. & 
% We should make sure everyone is clear on the format of the paper before we start writing. &
% Have a clear outline up for how we'll write the document before any of us start writing. \\ \hline
